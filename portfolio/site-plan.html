      <h4>Stuff I have done with computers:</h4>
      <h5>Early Beginnings</h5>
      <p>
In New Super Mario Bros Wii, there are "toad houses" that you can get powerups from. These work kind of like Concentration but without the memory component. You start with a 6x3 grid, not knowing what's on the back of any of the panels. If you match two powerups, you win one. If you match the cards with Bowser or Bowser Jr's face on them, the game ends. Unlike concentration, once a card is flipped, it stays flipped. At age 10, I reasoned that the layouts of these toad houses might not be randomly generated, so I started writing down the locations of every single panel that I flipped over. The result of this was that my dad published my research on a subpage of his website, https://jumpingfishes.com/poweruppanels. He had to fill in gaps and errors in my research with existing online resources, but this story still shows how much experience I have had working with and thinking about computers, even from a young age.
      </p>
      <h5>TI-83</h5>
      <p>
        In Junior High, a friend of mine programmed his TI-83 graphing calculator to play a "guess the number" game. I thought that that was so cool, and I wanted to learn how to do it myself. If I recall correctly, my calculator (we were all required to own the same model due to Texas Instruments' monopoly) came with an owner's manual, which included instructions for how to program it. So, I taught myself BASIC, which was pretty easy because the entire point of the language is to be easy to learn, hence the name, and eventually figured out how to replicate my friend's program, and even make my own changes to it. Later on, in high school, I would program Snake on it, which was far more difficult, and far more rewarding.
      </p>
      <p>I don't have that TI-83 with me anymore, but here is an image for reference if you've never seen Snake before.</p>

      <h3>Minecraft Redstone Circuits</h3>
      <p>I also started learning more advanced concepts through Minecraft. The redstone in Minecraft has been known for over a decade now to be Turing complete, and several people have designed CPUs out of it. For my part, in high school I made a binary adder, and around my freshman year of college I added subtraction, and then a single digit 7-segment display hexadecimal output made of redstone lamps. I also learned to master the in-game command system, which uses JSON formatting to allow the player to perform tasks usually reserved for the game's internal code. I still don't fully understand what JSON is and when I told my dad about this he said that didn't make sense because JSON isn't a programming language. So in case you find that as confusing as my dad does, the best explanation I can offer is that I think JSON is used to contain the arguments for the function that you want to execute, and then the game's engine interprets that data as an executable command. But, having never encountered JSON outside of Minecraft, I still don't understand it's normal function. One day I hope to implement multiplication and long division as well, but I haven't tested my ideas about how they would work.</p>

      <h3>Risk</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        After graduating high school, I began studying at BYU-I in January of 2020 before those studies were interrupted by COVID-19, cancer, and my mission. Before I served my mission, though, my dad said he wanted the board game Risk for Christmas, and when I realized that Risk doesn't have any features that are particularly difficult to code, I decided to make it from scratch in Visual Studio. It remains as the project I am most proud of thus far.
