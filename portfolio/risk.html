        <p>
            After graduating high school, I began studying at BYU-I in January of 2020 before those studies 
            were interrupted by COVID-19, cancer, and my mission. Before I served my mission, though, my dad 
            said he wanted the board game Risk for Christmas, and when I realized that Risk doesn't have any 
            features that are particularly difficult to code, I decided to make it from scratch in Visual Studio. 
            It remains as the project I am most proud of thus far.

        <h3 class="paragraph-title">An Awful Lot of Copyright</h3>
        <p>
            The only problem with this is that Risk is still a popular game, with other, professionally made 
            digital versions which are actively played and producing revenue today, 
            so I don't dare to publish my version online, for fear of copyright infringement. 
            I got the map from the Wikipedia article about Risk, which is an SVG file, which meant I never had 
            to worry about resolution, which was great. The sound effects are also not original, after trying 
            to find copyright-free sound effects online and getting frustrated with how long it took to find 
            what I was looking for, I realized I could rip sound effects from Minecraft's assets folder, 
            because I already know what all of those sounds sound like.

        <h3 class="paragraph-title">The Making of the Game</h3>
        <p>
            As for the actual programming of the game, the only part that I didn't write myself is a 
            function to detect whether an arbitrary point is inside of an arbitrary polygon, because the 
            Territory objects I use are not rectangles. They can have any number of sides greater than two, 
            and they are not necessarily convex, which makes the math substantially more complicated. In 
            fact, it turns out this problem has it's own Wikipedia article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon" target="_blank">Point in Polygon Problem</a>. 
            I did, however, write all of the game's logic myself, and the biggest hurdle that I didn't see 
            coming is that I wanted to make the color of a territory lighter to indicate when it was 
            selected by the player. I wasn't satisfied with how it looked if I used Color.LightBlue as the 
            light version of Color.Blue, and so on, and so all six of the lighter versions of the colors 
            have hand-picked RGB values. That really opened my eyes to the invisible world of good design. 
            (I specify "good", because when design is poor, you see it.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Another thing that is easy for human intuition to take for granted is how all the territories 
            connect to each other. When we look at the board, we deduce which territories can attack which 
            territories without even thinking about it, because it uses good design. I, however, had to 
            write a hundred or so lines of code just to initialize the board so that every territory would 
            know which territories were connected to it. It gets even worse when you want to fortify at the 
            end of your turn, because then you have to know whether the player controls a valid pathway 
            between the two territories they just selected, which effectively forced me to write a 
            maze-solving algorithm. It didn't have to be efficient, but I think my code could handle a 
            custom map unless it was deliberately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_(mathematics)" target="_blank">pathological</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In total, I wrote about 2,000 lines of code. I don't think any of my other projects come close to that total. I would check, but I've lost access to a lot of what I've written. I'm pretty satisfied with how the game runs currently, but three problems (that I know of) remain.
