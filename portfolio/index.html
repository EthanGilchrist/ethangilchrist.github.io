            I'm planning on adding more content than what I currently have, but I don't have time right now, 
            so although this isn't the finished state of the HTML, I hope it is an adequate one. 
            Also, I don't know how to do the gallery thing on the main page that I had in my site plan, 
            I'm probably going to need your help with that one in class.

        <h3 class="paragraph-title">Introduction</h3>
        <p>I am, as of March 2025, a sophomore at BYU-I majoring in Computer Science. 
            This website is the final project for my Web Fundamentals (WDD 130) class. 
            I decided it would be great for this to be of use outside of class, so I decided to create a 
            portfolio, almost like an interactive resume, but slightly more fun and moderately less formal. 
            What follows is pretty much a big long list of things I have done with computers. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="paragraph-title">Early Beginnings</h3>
        <p>
            In New Super Mario Bros Wii, there are "toad houses" that you can get powerups from. These 
            work kind of like Concentration but without the memory component. You start with a 6x3 
            grid, not knowing what's on the back of any of the panels. If you match two powerups, you 
            win one. If you match the cards with Bowser or Bowser Jr's face on them, the game ends. 
            Unlike concentration, once a card is flipped, it stays flipped. At age 10, I reasoned that 
            the layouts of these toad houses might not be randomly generated, so I started writing down 
            the locations of every single panel that I flipped over. The result of this was that my dad 
            published my research on a subpage of his website, <a href="https://jumpingfishes.com/poweruppanels">https://jumpingfishes.com/poweruppanels</a>. 
            He had to fill in gaps and errors in my research with existing online resources, but this 
            story still shows how much experience I have had working with and thinking about computers, 
            even from a young age. Even at age 10, I was able to form a hypothesis about how a computer worked, 
            test it, and leverage my findings to my advantage.

        <h3 class="paragraph-title">TI-83</h3>
        <p>
            In Junior High, a friend of mine programmed his TI-83 graphing calculator to play a 
            "guess the number" game. I thought that that was so cool, and I wanted to learn how to do 
            it myself. If I recall correctly, my calculator (we were all required to own the same 
            model due to Texas Instruments' monopoly) came with an owner's manual, which included 
            instructions for how to program it. So, I taught myself BASIC, which was pretty easy 
            because the entire point of the language is to be easy to learn, hence the name, and 
            eventually figured out how to replicate my friend's program, and even make my own changes 
            to it. Later on, in high school, I would program Snake on it, which was far more difficult, 
            and far more rewarding.
        </p>
        <p>I don't have that TI-83 with me anymore, but here is an image for reference if you've never seen Snake before.</p>

        <h3 class="paragraph-title">High School</h3>
        <p>I finally started my formal education in programming in high school. For our second semester, 
            we were given a large, long-term group project in which we implemented an old game called Hunt 
            the Wumpus. My progress was slow for a very long time, until one day, the concept of what a Class 
            in C# was finally clicked in my head, and I was able to start making real progress. Our teacher 
            told us one day as we were getting close to the deadline that he would keep the classroom open 
            after school, so we could work with our teams for as long as we needed, and we got to work. We 
            made steady progress for probably about eight hours until my teacher said he would not be able 
            to fulfill his promise of keeping the classroom open as long as we needed, because he didn't 
            think we would stay that long, and the school's security system was about to arm itself for the 
            night. So we had to leave, and I was very disappointed that I had to go. And then it hit me. I 
            had been at school doing work for well over 12 hours at that point, and I was sad to stop 
            working on my project? That was when I decided that programming was something I could do for a 
            career. As a personal note, our versions of Hunt the Wumpus actually rendered the map, unlike 
            most of the playable versions I've found online. It was also unique in that we used a 
            hexagonal map, which prevented us from using the simple geometry of a square grid.
        </p>
        <p>Once again, I no longer have access to our original project, but this picture 
            is very close to how our game worked.
